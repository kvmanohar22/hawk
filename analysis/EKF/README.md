- `log_84_2020-7-8-11-52-52.ulg`: [MMM corridor] First flight log. Doesn't seem to be stable in position mode.
- `log_85_2020-7-8-13-01-14.ulg`: [MMM corridor] Second test flight. Lot of change in z. Even without change in the setpoints, the drone behaved awkwardly moving.
- `log_87_2020-7-7-16-47-18.ulg`: [MMM corridor] Vision yaw estimation. To check whether yaw estimation is going crazy
- `log_88_2020-7-7-16-50-29.ulg`: [MMM corridor] Magnetometer yaw estimation. Same as above.
- `log_0_2020-7-8-22-27-34.ulg` : [MMM front] Check GPS position. Wanted to know how accurate tracking is

- `log_3_2020-7-9-11-34-18.ulg` : [MMM corridor] Altitude mode yaw change reaction. Height mode: barometer, yaw: magnetometer(auto)
- `log_4_2020-7-9-11-35-16.ulg` : [MMM corridor] Altitude mode. yaw was the same. Above and this used to assertain if yaw estimation is right. Height mode: barometer, yaw: magnetometer(auto)
- `log_6_2020-7-9-14-52-16.ulg` : [MMM front] ~~Altitude mode testing with yaw change. Height mode: barometer, yaw: magnetometer(auto). larger height~~ Better altitude stabilization when altitude is high. Barometer is able to estimate height with ore 
- `log_7_2020-7-9-14-53-26.ulg` : [MMM front] ~~Altitude mode testing with yaw change. Height mode: barometer, yaw: magnetometer(auto). low altitude testing~~
- `log_8_2020-7-9-14-57-28.ulg` : [MMM corridor] Altitude testing continuous change. Height mode: barometer, yaw: magnetometer(auto)
- `log_10_2020-7-9-15-30-26.ulg`: [MMM corridor] Height mode: barometer, yaw: magnetometer(3-axis). Yaw should be better here.
