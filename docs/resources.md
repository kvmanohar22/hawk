7. Addressing rotor drag and making the quadrotor differentially flat. This needs to be addressed in case of high velocity trajectory tracking. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmMgx_vKh5s&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmMgx_vKh5s&feature=youtu.be)
  1. What's rotor drag?
  2. How can this be minimized?
  3. This is addressed in the above paper.
  4. Also checkout the trajectory helpers.
